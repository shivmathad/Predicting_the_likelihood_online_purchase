# Predicting_the_likelihood_online_purchase

Data has been taken from UCI repository, here I am trying to predict the likelihood online purchase based numerous digital footprint that is left behind by the customer while browsing and purchasing for a product.
The data is imbalanced instead of using a traditional way (SMOTE) which deals with such kind of data. I have used threshold to predict the class. and Youdens J score to get threshold that suits best to predict target variable.
I have used DecisionTree, Random Forest and SVM classifier
